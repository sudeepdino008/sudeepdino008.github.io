"Useless student who doesn't study and then comes and asks stupid questions."
Said a college professor to me when I asked a "stupid question" in mechanics class. I don't remember what the question was. What I remember is that it didn't seem so obvious. Maybe there was a communication gap. Needless to say, after and due to this incident, I stopped asking any questions in college -- That's what I would like to believe. 
The real reason I didn't ask many questions because it wasn't really a habit to me. Throughout my student life, my focus had been to have the right answers. Questions were a sure shot way to get spotted, and for someone who considered his teachers (most of them) as towering tyrants who commanded respect, I did not want to get spotted. If you want to ask a question, you have to raise you hand, then the teacher spots you, then you stand up and ask your question. You were expected to be satisfied with the answer, otherwise oh well! You don't get it, and should just study more. Counter questions never really happened as the teacher's patience grew thin. 
Our education system is derived from the Prussian education model, whose purpose was to enable students to read and write, for the sole purpose of following orders while servind in the military or government desk jobs. It was never meant to teach the art of questioning. Regardless, this is not the place to vent out on pedagogical issues. 
One of the major things I like about my job as a software engineer is that you can ask questions. Even to people above you on the corporate hierarchy. It took some time to get the hang of it, but the experience came as a relief. Before we try to answer something, we must decide on the question. As we try to navigate complex space in driving behavior, we must think in questions. It might not be an exaggeration to say that moving up this hierarchy is just a matter of asking better and more impactful questions. As such I have to make conscious efforts to get into the habit of questions -- to turn on that switch and get into inquiry mode. This is where the idea of a "question session" came up -- For 30 minutes, I just roam around the house or outside, and note any questions that popped in my head. Sometimes the questions come clearly, and are factual. Sometimes you have to take note of any "confusion" in your mind. You have to be aware of that, and then capture it in words.
One thing I realized from this: There are many common things which I never considered interesting after learning about it a long time back. Now I seem to have forgotton about it, and their understanding is very thin, compromising just of some vague concepts incoheretly tied together. I've listed a few of them down and attempted to answer them.


> Is there a branch of mathematics which study which plots are aesthetic? 
Another way to put the above question - given an equation of a curve, can you determine if it's "aesthetic" (without plotting it in our head or otherwise)?

We know that fractals and golden ratios often lead to beautiful curves. I'm sure you've heard of Apple's logo extensively using golden ratios ([not really](https://www.fastcompany.com/1672682/debunking-the-myth-of-apple-s-golden-ratio David Cole's amazing debunking of Apple's golden ratio myth)).  

The way I see it, the answer is yes and no. 

Yes, mathematical concepts have been used in art and architecture to create stunning works. M. C. Escher for example has a huge body of work exploring optical illusion, infinity, recurrence. Fibonacci numbers is used in Tool's Lateralus, while projective geometry was used in the development of perspective theory of Renaissance art. But these mathematical concepts (let's call them magic recipes) get adopted by artists precisely because they have proved to be effective in the past. It's almost trite to mention that golden ratios have a tendency to produce beautiful results. More impressively, the artists are adept at making the golden ratio work for them. Stating generally, if we can recognise these magic recipes in equations, we might end up with aesthetic curves.

And no. Given an equation that has golden ratio (in some form), we might remark that the curve be aesthetic, but we can only do that because we have apriori knowledge about the effects of golden ratios. Imagine if 1.7449393 gave great results too, but no one knows about it. You won't know if the curve containing it will be beautiful, because unlike the golden ratio, the visual effects of this aribtrary number has not been explored. It seems then that any comment on aesthetics of a resultant curve is based on your repertoire of the magic recipes, which in turn is only established empirically. You cannot comment reasonably about the aesthetics of the plot of an equation if you cannot recognise in it any of the magic recipes you know.

Coming back to my original question, it seems like we can comment on the aesthetics of a curve by looking at its equation, insofar as we can recognise mathematical concepts which seem to give beautiful results - symmetry, recurrence, golden ratios and so on. There's no comprehensive theory which can determine which equations produce great curves.

Such a theory would have been very interesting. So, I'm disappointed at not finding one. On the way however I discovered some great works on algorithmic art. Here's one created by Structure Synth - an application for creating 3D structures from user specified rules:
