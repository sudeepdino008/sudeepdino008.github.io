Sparta - the legendary Greek city-state which rose to prominence during the Pelopennasian war owing to its invincible soldiers. It was famous for its stable goverment and simple life, while the heroics of Spartan warriors are glorified to this date with movies like 300 (and their parodies). 
It evokes an unusual revererance for them, and like all extremes, one has to be careful about this. Sparta's story can be viewed in two ways - the supposed reality and the prevalant myth. 
We'll talk about the later first. Plato was born during the early years of Pelopennasian war (which the Spartans had ultimately won) - a war that marked the beginning of Athens decline. Plato had a distate for democracy - Whereas Sparta was siding towards the totalitarian end in the political scale, Athens was democratic. Combine the fact that it was a democracy that executed his beloved teacher Socrates, the Spartan education system and administration inspired Plato's <i>Republic</i>, wherein he explores what an ideal state is and how it can be achieved. This rhetorical rendering of Sparta in the Republic read again and again by generations, finally led a biographer/author names Plutarch to write his <TODO>. It was a blatant glorification of Sparta - about how wonderful the education system is, the simplicity of a Spartan citizen, the chastitiy of women and so on. It is this lens of glorified myth with which people love to view Sparta. Glorified - because Plutarch and Sparta at its peak are about 200 years apart, the same as us and Columbus (oh! Don't we glorify Columbus too?)
Even though Plutarch is an important source of reference for historians, it's almost unanimously agreed that the representation is too exaggerated and one-sided. This brings us to the second lens with whhichh to view Sparta - the supposed reality. This picture is painted by Aristotle, who was a contemporary of Sparta at its peak. The view he paints is an ordinary, if not bleak, picture of Sparta. The women held too much power and lived in luxory and were much unconstrained compared to the men. They were virtually outside the law and resisted all attempts to fix this. Despite the emphasis on simplicity and frugality, it was well held that there's no Spartan who'd refuse a bribe. A full blown account is not needed here, for that's not the purpose of this post.
Spartanization - the glorification of ancient events/people/philosophy etc. is something we're all susceptible too. We don't want to pass on some ancient philosophy because giving it the benefit of doubtseems to be the most rational thing - what if those ancient philosophers knew their stuff? What if they are right? But we don't stop at scepticism, do we? Everyone loves a glorified heroic story. Reality on the other hand is boring. You don't stop at just asking "what if its true?" - you roll further down, and believe in a polarized view. 
Don't we view Gandhi and Hitler in such black and white terms too?
The impulse to Spartanize might also contribute to believing in authority as much as you don't ask questions or hear their arguments. Authority or ancient-ness is a proof whose strength is often exaggerated. Stop glorifying. Avoid a binary view. Poke some holes, and ask questions.
