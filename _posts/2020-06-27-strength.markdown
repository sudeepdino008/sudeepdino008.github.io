Never underestimate darkness  
no matter how far from it you rise,  
A cold cloudy day  
to which you wake  
from that horrid dream,  
brings all the suffering back.  
The impulse to hide  
turning to the dark side.  
Strength then  
is not punching through walls,  
but picking yourself  
even after darkness begins to claim you.
