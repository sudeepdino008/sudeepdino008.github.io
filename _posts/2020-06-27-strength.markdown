Never underestimate darkness  
no matter how far from it you rise,  
A cold cloudy day  
to which you wake  
from a horrid dream,  
can bring all the suffering back.  
The impulse to hide  
as you turn over to the dark side.  
Strength then  
is not punching through walls,  
but picking yourself up  
even after darkness begins to take you.
