Hello my imaginary readers!

I'm sure not all readers of this blog will be imaginary - there will be friends and colleagues who are obligated to check it out when I casually point it out to them about this.

I seek to use this for my own use - Teaching is the one of the best way to learn. As such, blogging things here will force me to structure my thoughts and ask more questions. Occasionally, there will be poems (in fact I'll start with one) and a few ramblings. 

Really, I don't guarantee anything. :)
