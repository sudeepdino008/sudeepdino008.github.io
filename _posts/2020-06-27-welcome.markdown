Hello my imaginary readers!

I'm sure not all readers of this blog will be imaginary - there will be friends and colleagues who are obligated to check it out when I casually point this to them.

I seek to use this for my own benefit - Teaching is one of the best way to learn. As such, blogging things will force me to structure my thoughts and ask more questions. 

Occasionally, there will be poems (in fact I'll start with one) and a few ramblings.

Those are the intial thoughts. Though really, I don't guarantee anything. :)
